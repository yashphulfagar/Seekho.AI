## **Prerequisites**
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher
- **Git**: For cloning the repository

## **Installation**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
Open your terminal (CMD, Powershell, or Bash) and run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AryanCodesDS/soft-engg-project-may-2024-se-may-20.git
```

Alternatively, you can use GitHub Desktop to clone the repository.

### 2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd soft-engg-project-may-2024-se-may-20
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

- On **Windows**:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**
Install all required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: The installation size is roughly 3 GB, so ensure you have sufficient disk space available.

## **Configuration**

Before running the application, you need to configure the API keys:

1. Open `chatbot.py` and `llm_setup.py`.
2. Add your **Google Cloud Generative AI** API keys and **Pinecone Vector DB** API keys in the respective files.

## **Running the Application**

To start the application, use one of the following commands:

- On **Windows**:
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```

- On **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  python3 app.py
  ```

## **Usage**

1. Once the application is running, open your web browser and visit:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```
   
2. Click on the "Sign in with Google" button and sign in using your **IITM BS student email ID**.

   **Note**: We only collect your email and profile picture, ensuring that your personal data remains 100% safe.

3. Explore the portal and enjoy the new and exciting features!

## **Troubleshooting**

If you encounter any issues:
- Ensure your Python version is 3.10 or higher.
- Check if all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Verify that your API keys are correctly configured in `chatbot.py` and `llm_setup.py`.
- If the app doesnâ€™t start, make sure your virtual environment is activated.
